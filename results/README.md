# Results Folder

This folder contains **evaluation outputs and figures** generated by the EdgeSynth pipeline.

## Files & Outputs

### 1. Distribution Comparisons
- KDE plots for **WindSpeed**, **PowerOutput**, **RotorSpeed**, **GeneratorSpeed**, **GeneratorTemperature**  
- Real vs. synthetic overlays showing statistical fidelity.  
- Produced by `scripts/week4.py`.

### 2. Correlation Heatmaps
- Pearson correlation matrices for **real** and **synthetic** datasets.  
- Confirms preservation of multivariate structure.  
- Produced by `scripts/week4.py`.

### 3. Regression Performance
- Random Forest regressors trained on:
  - **Real data** → MAE ≈ 0.04, R² ≈ 1.00  
  - **Synthetic data** → MAE ≈ 0.03, R² ≈ 1.00  
- Results stored in `regression_results.csv`.  
- Visual error plots generated by `scripts/week4.py`.

### 4. Additional Evaluations (Synthetic-Only QA)
- Histograms, scatter plots, and boxplots of synthetic data quality.  
- Produced by `scripts/evaluate.py`.

### 5. Prototype Screenshots
- Streamlit app views (`app/app_streamlit.py`) showing:
  - Dataset preview  
  - Distribution overlays  
  - Correlation heatmaps  
  - Privacy heuristic plots (nearest-neighbor checks)

## Reproducibility Notes
- Figures are regenerated by running `scripts/week4.py` or `scripts/evaluate.py`.  
- All outputs are tied to the synthetic dataset `data/synthetic_scada_cleaned.csv`.  
- For transparency, keep both **plots** and **CSV metric summaries** in this folder.
